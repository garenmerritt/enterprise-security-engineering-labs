# A progressive capstone roadmap designed to build real-world technical depth and produce portfolio artifacts. 

This is structured as an evolving enterprise environment, where each lab adds controls, automation, and documentation. No need to tear down and build new each time.

# Ultimate Goal: 
 Build, secure, automate, and threat-model a modern Zero Trust enterprise. Provide an architecture case study, intermediate level scripting, and clear rationale on security choices.
